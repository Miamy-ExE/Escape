# Escape
A ~small~ _small my a##_ way too big project that i picked up somewhere

## Why?
I had the opportunity to better my grade a little and we had "We Were Liars", so i decided to theme an escape room after the novel.  
And because i watched too much [GameTheory](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo_IB5145EVNcf8hw1Kku7w) i just had to include an ARG.  
<sup>*i really have a problem with free time..*</sup>
